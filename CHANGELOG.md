# CHANGELOG

## 0.9.0 (unreleased)

* add support for specifying custom SSH port of a managed server

## 0.8.0 (released 2016-11-04)

* add Vagrant 1.8.5 compatibility and fix TravisCI build (see [#64](https://github.com/tknerr/vagrant-managed-servers/pull/64))
* decouple from [vagrant-winrm-syncedfolders](https://github.com/Cimpress-MCP/vagrant-winrm-syncedfolders), which now needs to be installed separately (see [#65](https://github.com/tknerr/vagrant-managed-servers/pull/65), which reverts [#51](https://github.com/tknerr/vagrant-managed-servers/pull/51) and applies [#50](https://github.com/tknerr/vagrant-managed-servers/pull/50). thanks @chrisbaldauf!)
* ensure rsync does not keep stale files by adding the `--del` option (see [#61](https://github.com/tknerr/vagrant-managed-servers/issues/61), thanks @stephencooke!)
* add support for `vagrant share` command (see [#67](https://github.com/tknerr/vagrant-managed-servers/pull/67), thanks @nigelgbanks!)
* using the vagrant builtin SyncedFolder implementation (see [#68](https://github.com/tknerr/vagrant-managed-servers/pull/68)), which also fixes:
   * [#17](https://github.com/tknerr/vagrant-managed-servers/pull/17) Reuse Rsync Action from Vagrant Core
   * [#24](https://github.com/tknerr/vagrant-managed-servers/pull/24) rsync__exclude does not work
   * [#52](https://github.com/tknerr/vagrant-managed-servers/pull/52) vagrant rsync and vagrant rsync-auto not working

## 0.7.1 (released 2015-05-22)

* fix bug where the vagrant-winrm-syncedfolders plugin dependency is not properly loaded (see [#49](https://github.com/tknerr/vagrant-managed-servers/issues/49), thanks @chrisbaldauf for the fix!)

## 0.7.0 (released 2015-05-22)

* extract the WinRM synced folder mechanism into [a separate plugin](https://github.com/Cimpress-MCP/vagrant-winrm-syncedfolders) (see [#47](https://github.com/tknerr/vagrant-managed-servers/pull/47), thanks @chrisbaldauf!)
* use the `Vagrant::Action::Builtin::SyncedFolders` for provisioning windows guests. This will use (the much faster) SMB synced folders if possible (see [README](https://github.com/tknerr/vagrant-managed-servers#synced-folders-windows)), otherwise fall back to the WinRM implementation above (see [#46](https://github.com/tknerr/vagrant-managed-servers/issues/46), thanks @chrisbaldauf!)

* document / validate vagrant 1.6+ compatibility which is required for winrm ([#40](https://github.com/tknerr/vagrant-managed-servers/issues/40), thanks @LiamK for reporting!)

## 0.6.0 (released 2015-03-16)
